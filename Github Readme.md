The dissolved oxygen may take up electrons directly to from $\ce{OH-}$ ions as follows :
$$\ce{O2 + 4H2O + 4e- -> 4OH-}$$
The over all reaction of the miniature cell will be :
$$\ce{2Fe(s) + O2(g) + 4H+(aq) -> Fe^2+(aq) + 2H2O(l)}$$


##### **4.** The ferrous ions formed react with the dissolved oxygen or oxygen from air to from ferric oxide as follows:
$$\ce{4Fe^2+ + O2 + 4H2O -> 2Fe2O3 + 8H+(aq)}$$
Ferric oxide then undergoes hydration to form Rust as follows :
$$\ce{\underset{Ferric Oxide}{Fe2O3} + xH2O -> \underset{Hydrated Ferric Oxide (Rust)}{Fe2O3xH2O}}$$
